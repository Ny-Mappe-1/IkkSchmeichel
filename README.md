[**IkkSchmeichel**](https://computers.mikkelmalmberg.com/issues/35) is an app that tells you if the person you just took a photo of is in fact the legendary Danish goal keeper Peter Schmeichel.

I built it for my comedy show _Ny Mappe (1)_.

## Setup

I used the things in `trainer/` to train the API. The rest is turning that API endpoint into an actual iOS app.
